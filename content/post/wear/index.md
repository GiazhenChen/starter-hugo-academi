Wear usually results in an increase in the roughness of the material, but not always. Wear refers to the process of gradual wear and destruction of the surface of a material, which can be caused by friction, abrasion, scraping or other mechanisms. These effects increase the small dents, marks and breakage on the surface of the material, resulting in an increase in roughness. For example, polishing is also a kind of wear, which depends on the nature of the material itself and the wear mechanism and other factors.

When two surfaces rub against each other, the harder material usually creates wear on the softer material. Friction and pressure can cause the tiny particles on the surface of the material to be scraped, abraded or destroyed. These processes can lead to dents and irregular features on an otherwise smooth surface, which in turn increases roughness. Of course, in other cases such as abrasive wear mechanisms, soft materials often cause damage to hard materials
