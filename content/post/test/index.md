When two surfaces rub against each other, the harder material usually creates wear on the softer material. Friction and pressure can cause the tiny particles on the surface of the material to be scraped, abraded or destroyed. These processes can lead to dents and irregular features on an otherwise smooth surface, which in turn increases roughness. Of course, in other cases such as abrasive wear mechanisms, soft materials often cause damage to hard materials
