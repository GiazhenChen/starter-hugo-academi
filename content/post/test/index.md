In general, when abnormal wear occurs, if left untreated, the wear rate will increase over time. For example, in the case of engine crankshaft bearings or cylinder liner piston rings, wear tends to accelerate. However, the situation appears to be different for polymers. Due to the presence of transfer films, the friction coefficient is reduced, and the contact surfaces are lubricated, resulting in decreasing wear over time. In experiments, it has been observed that the thickness of polymer coatings initially decreases rapidly, but once a uniform and stable transfer film is formed, the rate of thickness reduction slows down. This characteristic may have new applications in certain scenarios.
