Hello, This is Jiazhen "George" Chen(陈佳镇). Currently, I work as a research assistant at the State Key Laboratory of Tribology In Advanced Equipment at Tsinghua University. I am a member of Professor [Dan Guo](https://www.me.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1117/1717.htm)'s research group. My research project aims to understand the impact of texture on the formation of PTFE transfer films. I am passionate about finding solutions to minimize energy loss due to friction and implementing improvements through the use of innovative materials.

Before joining SKLT, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Marine Engineering and Bachelor degree in Laws from Wuhan University of technology where i worded with Prof.Zhiwei Guo and Dr.Xingxin Liang on how to improve the tribology of water-lubricated bearings.

Outside of work, you will find me playing basketball/cycling/bridge/unlock
