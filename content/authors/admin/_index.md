Hello, This is Jiazhen "George" Chen(陈佳镇). Currently, I work as a research assistant at the State Key Laboratory of Tribology In Advanced Equipment at Tsinghua University. I am a member of Professor Dan Guo's research group. My research project aims to understand the impact of texture on the formation of PTFE transfer films. I am passionate about finding solutions to minimize energy loss due to friction and implementing improvements through the use of innovative materials.

Before joining SKLT,I obtained my Bachelor degree in Marine Engineering and Bachelor degree in Laws from Wuhan University of technology where i worded with Prof.Zhiwei Guo and Dr.Xingxin Liang on how to improve the tribology of water-lubricated bearings.

Outside of work，you will find me playing basketball/cycling/unlock
