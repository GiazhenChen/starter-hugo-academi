Hello, This is Jiazhen "George" Chen(陈佳镇). Currently, I work as a research assistant at [the State Key Laboratory of Tribology In Advanced Equipment](http://sklt.tsinghua.edu.cn/EN2022/Home.htm) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am a member of [Prof.Dan Guo](https://me.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1048/1310.htm)'s research group. My research project aims to understand the impact of texture on the formation of PTFE transfer films. I am passionate about finding solutions to minimize energy loss due to friction and implementing improvements through the use of innovative materials.

Before joining [SKLT](http://sklt.tsinghua.edu.cn/EN2022/Home.htm), I obtained my Bachelor degree in Marine Engineering and Bachelor degree in Laws from [Wuhan University of technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/) where I worded with [Prof.Zhiwei Guo](https://stle.whut.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/jgml/202109/t20210913_851370.shtml#) and [Dr.Xingxin Liang](https://naoep.whut.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/202109/t20210912_851100.shtml) on how to improve the tribology of water-lubricated bearings.

Outside of work, you will find me playing basketball/cycling/bridge/unlock
