The quality of abc transfer films plays a critical role in determining the tribological performance and service life of sliding components. This study investigates the mechanism of PTFE transfer film formation under low contact pressure and high sliding speed, focusing on the role of surface laser texturing. Both smooth and three types of laser-textured CrN-coated surfaces were prepared as fixed counterparts, while the rotating counterpart was coated with PTFE. Experimental results show that lower contact pressures promote the formation of more uniform and stable transfer films. Among the tested textures, vertical grooves perpendicular to the sliding direction demonstrated superior film formation by collecting and redistributing PTFE debris, and the lowest average wear rate. Depth-profile XPS analysis further revealed that transfer films adjacent to grooves were significantly thicker than those in flat regions, indicating a micro-scale debris transport mechanism that continuously supplies material to groove edges. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic formation–removal–reformation behavior of PTFE transfer films and offer design guidelines for high-quality tribological surface structures at low contact pressure.
