### Project Description

Our research explores how **laser peening** can improve the strength, fatigue resistance, and surface properties of metals. The project covers:

- Residual stress development
- Microstructure evolution
- Tribological performance improvement
- Fatigue life extension in various alloys

### ðŸ“Œ Key Findings

- Significant reduction in surface roughness  
- Increase in surface hardness (measured via nanoindentation)  
- Decrease in coefficient of friction  
- Improvement in wear resistance and crack suppression
