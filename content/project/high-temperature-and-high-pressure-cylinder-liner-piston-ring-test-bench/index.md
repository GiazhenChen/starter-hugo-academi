**Project Title: Development of a Test Rig for Performance Verification of Piston Ring-Cylinder Liner in Simulated Gas-Fueled Environment**

**Project Overview:** The objective of this project is to develop an innovative test rig for performance verification of piston ring-cylinder liner in a simulated gas-fueled environment, addressing the need for frictional performance testing in hydrogen/ammonia fuel conditions. The test rig utilizes a hydraulic cylinder as the power source and employs a statically sealed hydraulic transmission system to achieve the reciprocating motion of the piston ring. By utilizing static sealing hydraulic transmission, the test rig ensures enhanced safety and sealing reliability while accurately simulating the reciprocating motion of the piston ring. The project integrates key components such as the lubricating oil supply system and ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement device to facilitate the performance verification and study of frictional wear mechanisms in the piston ring-cylinder liner interface.

**Project Highlights:**

1. Statically sealed hydraulic transmission: By utilizing a hydraulic cylinder as the power source and achieving static sealing, the test rig overcomes the challenges associated with dynamic sealing encountered when using conventional motor-based systems. This approach enhances the safety and sealing reliability of the test platform, ensuring accurate simulation of the reciprocating motion of the piston ring.
2. Simulation of real gas-fueled environment: Through coordination with the fuel supply system, the test rig provides the required type of fuel and creates a simulated gas-fueled environment within the sealed chamber, enabling experiments under realistic working conditions.
3. Performance verification of the frictional interface: The developed rig enables performance verification experiments for the piston ring-cylinder liner frictional interface. By monitoring friction coefficients, wear rates, lubricating oil film thickness, and other relevant data during the frictional process, the project aims to study the frictional wear mechanisms and control mechanisms of the interface comprehensively.
4. Ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement technology: The test rig incorporates an ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement device to accurately monitor the lubricating oil film thickness in the frictional interface. This non-contact measurement technique eliminates the interferences associated with traditional contact resistance methods and ensures precise and reliable measurements even in high-temperature, high-pressure, and hydrogen/ammonia environments.

**Project Achievements:** This project has successfully developed a test rig for performance verification of piston ring-cylinder liner in a simulated gas-fueled environment, achieving the following outcomes:

1. Design and manufacture of the test platform, enabling performance verification experiments for the piston ring-cylinder liner frictional interface. The rig ensures accurate simulation of the reciprocating motion of the piston ring, providing a reliable experimental foundation for further research.
2. Development of a statically sealed hydraulic transmission system using a hydraulic cylinder as the power source, ensuring safe and reliable reciprocating motion of the piston ring. Compared to conventional dynamic sealing methods, this statically sealed hydraulic transmission system effectively addresses safety concerns and sealing reliability.
3. Implementation of a lubricating oil supply system to provide adequate lubrication for the frictional interface and minimize interference with frictional motion. This ensures that the frictional interface operates under favorable lubrication conditions, yielding accurate performance data.
4. Integration of an ultrasonic oil film thickness measurement device, utilizing ultrasonic technology to monitor the lubricating oil film thickness in the frictional interface. This non-contact measurement method eliminates interferences and enhances the accuracy and reliability of the measurements.

The test rig for performance verification of piston ring-cylinder liner in a simulated gas-fueled environment holds significant potential for applications in hydrogen/ammonia fuel internal combustion engine research and development. It provides an important experimental platform and research tool for the design and optimization of internal combustion engines, contributing to the realization of scaled-up applications of hydrogen/ammonia energy in the transportation sector.
