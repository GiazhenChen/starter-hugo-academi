###### Project Title: **Study on the Performance of Water-Lubricated Stern Bearings for Ships**

###### **Project Introduction:**

This project aims to investigate the performance of water-lubricated stern bearings, focusing on addressing the issue of relatively shorter lifespan compared to traditional oil-lubricated bearings. Traditional stern bearings in ships have been predominantly lubricated with oil. However, with the increasing environmental consciousness and concerns regarding lubricating oil contamination, water-lubricated bearings have emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative gaining significant attention.

However, the current lifespan of water-lubricated bearings is relatively shorter, leading to frequent shaft replacements and substantial time and cost expenses for ship docking. The mainstream water-lubricated bearing material typically involves cast polyurethane, but there is room for improvement in its performance. Therefore, our research focuses on enhancing the performance of water-lubricated bearings, particularly by improving the material's thermal conductivity and wear resistance.

By enhancing the material's thermal conductivity, we can effectively dissipate heat and reduce bearing temperature, thus minimizing thermal stress on the bearings. To achieve this, we employ an innovative approach by embedding high thermal conductivity metal wires into the cast polyurethane material to improve its thermal conductivity. The metal wires facilitate efficient heat transfer, assisting in enhancing the thermal conduction aspect of water-lubricated bearings.

Additionally, we also address the enhancement of the material's wear resistance to reduce friction and prolong the bearing's lifespan. To achieve this, we apply a surface coating of high-strength polymeric material with excellent tensile properties to enhance surface durability and lubrication performance. Such improvement measures help decrease wear and extend the durability of water-lubricated bearings.

Through the utilization of simulation and analysis tools, we will conduct an in-depth study on the impact of these improvement measures on bearing performance, unraveling the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms. Our goal is to improve the lifespan of water-lubricated stern bearings, reduce the frequency of ship maintenance and associated costs, and promote the development and application of water-lubricated bearing technology.

**The objectives of this project are as follows:**

1. To enhance the lifespan of water-lubricated bearings to be on par with traditional oil-lubricated bearings.
2. To improve the thermal conductivity of water-lubricated bearing materials for efficient heat dissipation and temperature reduction.
3. To enhance the wear resistance of water-lubricated bearing materials for reduced wear and extended lifespan.
4. To evaluate the potential reduction in ship maintenance costs and improvements in ship reliability and availability through these improvement measures.

Methods and Procedures: We will employ the following methods to investigate the performance of water-lubricated stern bearings:

1. Embedding high thermal conductivity metal wires: We will embed high thermal conductivity metal wires into the cast polyurethane material to enhance its thermal conductivity. This will facilitate efficient heat transfer, resulting in reduced bearing temperature, minimized heat accumulation, and diminished thermal stress.
2. Surface reinforcement with high-strength polymeric material: We will reinforce the material by placing a layer of high-strength polymeric fiber fabric beneath the surface, which acts as a strengthening element. This approach cannot be referred to as a surface coating but rather as surface reinforcement. It enhances the material's strength and wear resistance, effectively reducing friction and wear, thus extending the lifespan of the bearings.
3. Simulation and analysis: We will utilize computer simulation and analysis tools to study the impact of these improvement measures on bearing performance. By simulating lubrication performance, heat conduction, and wear behavior, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

**Throughout the project, we anticipate the following outcomes and findings:**

1. For the improvement measure involving embedded high thermal conductivity metal wires, we expect to observe reduced bearing temperature, decreased thermal stress, and improved thermal conductivity.
2. Regarding the surface coating of high-strength polymeric material, we anticipate enhanced wear resistance and reduced wear on the bearings.
3. Through simulation and analysis, we will gain insights into the effects of these improvement measures on bearing performance, elucidating the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms.

**Contributions and Significance:** This research contributes significantly to the enhancement of water-lubricated stern bearing performance. By improving the thermal conductivity and wear resistance of the materials, we aim to extend the lifespan of water-lubricated bearings, reduce the frequency of ship maintenance, and minimize associated costs. This holds crucial importance for ship operations, reliability, and also advances the development and application of water-lubricated bearing technology.

**Conclusion and Future Outlook:** In conclusion, we will summarize the impact of the improvement measures on the performance of water-lubricated stern bearings, evaluating their effectiveness in improving bearing lifespan and reducing maintenance costs. Additionally, we will outline future research directions, such as further material composition enhancements, optimization of designs, and experimental validations, to further enhance the performance and reliability of water-lubricated bearings.
