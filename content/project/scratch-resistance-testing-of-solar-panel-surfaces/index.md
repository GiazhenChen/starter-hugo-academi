### Project Description

This project evaluates the scratch resistance of solar panel surfaces following the **IEC 62788-7-3:2024** standard. Using a multi-arm scratch tester (shown above), we systematically simulate mechanical abrasion scenarios that solar modules may encounter during installation, transportation, or long-term outdoor exposure.

The testing involves standardized abrasive loads, reciprocating motion, and controlled environmental conditions to assess the durability of antireflective coatings and glass surfaces. By quantifying the extent of scratch damage and comparing surface degradation across materials and coatings, we aim to provide insights for improving the longevity and robustness of photovoltaic modules.

* Based on: **IEC 62788-7-3-2024 (Standard Test Method for Scratch Resistance)**
* Key metrics: scratch depth, width, haze increase, and visual defects
* Applications: AR coatings, tempered glass, superhydrophobic films, and backsheet laminates
