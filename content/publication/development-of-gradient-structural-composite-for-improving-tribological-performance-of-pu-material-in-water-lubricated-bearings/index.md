abstract: Polymer materials have poor thermal conductivity and prone to aging at
  high temperatures. Severe wear occurs at material friction interfaces at high
  or locally high temperatures. In this study, gradient structural design for
  polyurethane was realized by adding high thermal-conductivity wire into
  water-lubricated bearing material. Tribological performance was evaluated by
  analysis of friction coefficients, wear microscopy, and average temperature
  during steady-state thermal simulation analysis. The results showed that metal
  wire effectively transferred heat and reduced sample temperature and the
  formed surface film effectively reduced the friction coefficient. These
  findings provided a new method for improving the thermal conductivity and wear
  resistance of water-lubricated bearing materials. The poor thermal
  conductivity of polymer bushing and the tribological performance of bearing is
  improved.
