abstract: Water-lubricated bearings are subject to abrasive wear, leading to
  performance degradation. Herein, the use of PTFE and UHMWPE fibers was
  investigated to improve surface tensile strength and explore wear mechanisms.
  Through finite element analysis and friction and wear experiments, it is
  hereby demonstrated that fiber reinforcement significantly improves surface
  tensile strength and reduces surface wear compared to non-reinforced
  materials, and the wear of the bronze plates is reduced as well. Meanwhile,
  fiber-reinforced composite materials suppress the development of wear in a
  certain amount of time and exhibit outstanding frictional performance.
