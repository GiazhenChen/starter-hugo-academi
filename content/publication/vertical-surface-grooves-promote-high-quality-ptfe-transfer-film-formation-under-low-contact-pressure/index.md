abstract: The quality of PTFE transfer films plays a critical role in
  determining the tribological performance and service life of sliding
  components. This study investigates the mechanism of PTFE transfer film
  formation under low contact pressure and high sliding speed, focusing on the
  role of surface laser texturing. Both smooth and three types of laser-textured
  CrN-coated surfaces were prepared as fixed counterparts, while the rotating
  counterpart was coated with PTFE. Experimental results show that lower contact
  pressures promote the formation of more uniform and stable transfer films.
  Among the tested textures, vertical grooves perpendicular to the sliding
  direction demonstrated superior film formation by collecting and
  redistributing PTFE debris, and the lowest average wear rate. Depth-profile
  XPS analysis further revealed that transfer films adjacent to grooves were
  significantly thicker than those in flat regions, indicating a micro-scale
  debris transport mechanism that continuously supplies material to groove
  edges. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic
  formation–removal–reformation behavior of PTFE transfer films and offer design
  guidelines for high-quality tribological surface structures at low contact
  pressure.
